# 🦋 Butterfly  
**Turning daily notes into meaning**

Butterfly is a compassionate documentation platform designed to help care teams transform everyday support notes into meaningful stories. Notes are the everyday observations, reflections, and updates that staff members write while supporting individuals with disabilities, things that often get lost in paperwork.
It’s built to show the person *behind* the paperwork: their routines, growth, and the places that matter to them.

## 🌤️ Why Butterfly

Every day, support staff record notes, track goals, and document progress.  
But buried in these logs are moments of joy, challenges, and change.

Butterfly brings these notes to life through maps, timelines, and clear reports that help caregivers, families, and organizations see the whole picture.
